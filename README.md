# PandasOptimisation
Optimize the Pandas code example with timing analysis done

# Method 1 : For loop with custom function
This is slowest method for pandas Dataframe

# Method 2 : Apply method with custom function
This is intermediate timed method for pandas but is much faster than for loop method

# Method 3 : Vectorization
This is fastest method of all . Always use vectorization in pandas to make it time efficient
